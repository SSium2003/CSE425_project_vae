(Are you there? Are you there? Are you there?)\nAre you there? (Are you there? Are you there? Are you there?)\nOr are you just a decoy dream in my head? (Are you there?

I'm hanging like some bored batters\nFlying out at night just to watch the whores scatter\nSure. I tend to get stuck up in the rafters\nDrifting with my thoughts, caught up in disasters;\nWhirlpools of slander, hurricane slam dancers\nBlur my brain faster, disturbing the gray matters\nI play the same caper I've played since day one:\nA plaster-cast bastard trying to stay out of the sun\nCool as alabaster, a pale-faced imitation\nStacking up my chips, getting cracks in my foundation\nUntil I found salvation in an hour-glass maiden\nTook a sip and couldn't quit--I love the way she tasted\nCouldn't flip the wasting, witness disintegration;\nCryptic communications got me twisted up and faded\nSo we build it up just to break it down\nThinking about thinking, getting over and around\nWe build it up just to break it down\nAs soon as we get up, we're thinking about getting down\nWhen she laughs, she shakes the ground, so\nCatch me sitting silent, trying to embrace the sound\nI'm waking now, breaking down every detail I've found\nDeciphering hieroglyphics--a pyro and a mystic\nMissile silos stand, mimic the war of Roses and Cynics\nBut all's fair, I guess. Stack up the matches and gimmicks\nWe package each shipment to distract all the minions, and\nIt looks great from a distance, but there's cracks in the finish\nI've mastered the method of packing up imperfections\nSweep dust under the carpet, a closet full of resurrections\nHeart beneath the floorboards, brain in the freezer section\nSo I can ignore all the problems for my own greedy protection\nThe resulting situation's made of cheap imitations\nNever gettin deep enough to complete the equation\nAll the numbers I get merely add to the frustration\n'Cause I know if I call you up, I risk over-stimulation\nThis game of cat and mouse got me savage with doubt\nI've got so much to say that I may never let get out\nAnd part of me thinks I should just break down and speak\nBut Time is usually a better cure for this type of disease\nIts never enough to ease the breakdown\nPlease never give up--my dreams are fake now\nThese treasures will rust. We need to break out\nSleep. Tremors. Combust. Bleed the pain out\nSo where you at?\nWhere's the bears and big cats?\nWhat's the haps?\nWhat damage is smashing your side of the map?\nLost in the woods\nBread crumbs swallowed by bats\nListen to your heart beat\nHow about you follow that\nSo where you at?\nWhere's the bears and big cats?\nWhat's the haps?\nWhat damage is smashing your side of the map?\nLost in the woods\nBread crumbs swallowed by bats\nListen to your heart beat\nHow about you follow that\nWe build it up just to break it down\nWe build it up just to break it down\nWe build it up just to break it down\nWe build it up just to break it down\nIts never enough to ease the breakdown\nPlease never give up--my dreams are fake now\nThese treasures will rust.

What up?”\n“We need to meet up and go half on this spliff”\n“That’s cool, but, first, I got to ditch this straggling bitch\n‘Cause, once she smell it, she wants to inhale it, always like\n'What’s popping?' but never come out of her pockets to get it\"\n“Ayyo, y’all trying to get the smoke, yo?” “Stop running\nYour mouth and hang up my phone.  This ain’t your house”\nShe like:\n] (x2)\nRoll that dro, please\nAnd lick.  Come on, son, roll that up\nAnd twist.  Come on, son, roll that up\nThat spliff.  Come on, son, roll that up\n\nHaha, Swave, we bounced without the spouses\nI know this house party that’s down a couple of houses\nThey got the Bacardi.  I copped a couple of ounces\nWe ‘bout to bent on a couch like some slouches\n\nWord?  Well, I got something to add.  May not be\nAs much as a ounce but it’s a nice-sized bag\nAnd it’s the highest strain that you could put in your body\nIt’s serious—I’ll let you smell it when we get in the lobby\nWhoa!  There’s a lot of hoes at this party\nOh!  Look at her.  I know she’s a hottie\nYo, pass me the Dutch, let me twist these trees.  Ayyo\nProbe, I think shorty’s licking her lips at me\n\nWoah, I think\nSo.  Shorty grinding like she toe-back\nThat’s when I pulled out something to roll like, “Hold that”\nThat’s when she strolled over, sat on me, gave me a lap dance\nWith romance in her voice, looking Janet-mold, she said:\n] (x2)\nRoll that dro, please\nAnd lick.  Come on, son, roll that up\nAnd twist.  Come on, son, roll that up\nThat spliff.  Come on, son, roll that up\n\nDamn it, yo\nI’m coming up short.  Yo, I got to get my cheese up\nLet me go outside and just strip you this re-up\nI just finished stuffing these bags.  Y’all better grab\nA couple dimes and dubs and post up on the ave\nIn spite of my nigga Ike, about to \"Walk On\" fast\n“Ayyo, Ike, what’s good, dawg?”  “I’ll stay in the hood, god\nYou’re just the person that I needed to see.  Give\nMe three.”  “Yo, keep your money, god.  This one’s on me.”  “Yo, look, yo\nWho this bitch that walking up with the cheese?”  “Yo, that’s that bitch\nShantise.  She always trying to burn the next man’s trees.”  “I seen you\nSmoking, Sevah.” “We’re busy.  You might as well continue\nYour route ‘cause there’s no way the blunt is touching your mouth”\n“Yo, keep it moving, Shanty.  Just walk that path straight\nDon’t be pulling that shit—it’s new-old and half-baked.”  Then right\nBefore she decided to skate, she licked her lips\nWith the thirst in her face.  She was dying to say, “Can we...”\n] (x2)\nRoll that dro, please\nAnd lick.  Come on, son, roll that up\nAnd twist.  Come on, son, roll that up\nThat spliff.  Come on, son, roll that up",

And if you understood\nThat, well then just know that this one is\nFor you\n\nThis one is for you (This one is for you), this one is for you (This one is for you)\nThis one is for you (This one is for you), this one is for you (This one is for you)\nThis one is for you\n\nAnd each and every one in my crew\nDon’t me mad.  Just be glad for the things that I do\nI’m the known king of slang.  Watch them niggas cling to\nMy bozack.  Talking this and that, I’ll have my girl sing to\nA fool.  Use each and every one of my tools\nTo have them thirst niggas drooling.  Cats be mad ‘cause I’m a-\n-llergic to high hats.  They’d rather have shiny raps\nCome on, who you fooling?  I’m all into music\nNot only do I like it dirty, grimy, infused with\nJazz.  You got to represent hip hop and rap your ass off\nNot ten percent hip hop, ninety percent do a rap song\nIf it’s true that this is what you do, well then this is for you\n (x8)\nAnd this is for you (And this is for you), and this is for you (And this is for you)\n\nInstead of getting props, I’m getting hours to swap tracks\nYou act like you wear the time—yo, stop that\nAnd you don’t rule Cvees and\nAnd I know majority, two out of three wins\nFuck it.  Don’t rhyme on my tracks, then try\nTo climb on my back after I blow when I’m fat\nI’ll design serene tracks to ease back\nAnd write in lash mode to keep drops intact\nProbe a hundred percent hip hop, not rap.  I’ll never\nDrip drop or hit the pit stop.  I’ll never\nFlip flop or floss a wristwatch.  Hot\nDamn, I’m a man that’ll get props.  And if\nYou stand in my way, you’ll just get mopped, so please\nStop popping all that shit.  I’m getting sick like\nThe flu, switched up my whole damn crew\nPimped ‘em.  If you got these symptoms, well then this for you\n (x8)\nAnd this is for you (And this is for you), and this is for you (And this is for you)\n\nYou’re mad ‘cause I’ll rock a Lo cap with a knapsack\nDamn right, motherfucker, I’m a backpacker\nAnd I’ll attack any of you sad, wack rappers\nWe’re real hip hoppers and y’all are all actors\nWe’re true emcees—y’all could all see the factors\nOf beats on envy and graffiti in the flat book\nFloat on my back with the flow that’s spectacular\nHold that, revert back to old rap vernacular\nIn case you forgot, my main\nPurpose is to preserve real hip hop, and all\nY’all deserve that hot hip hop, so here\nIt go.  Shit, play it out of control.  That’s how\nWe do it.  New shit out of the blue, kid\nYou stick it in the... with the phlegm as the fluid\nYou nah’m saying?  Shit.

Ike P) - “Spread Love to Ya”\n\n\nI know somebody who declares he's got it made\nHe won't admit it, but it's just a masquerade\n\nAyyo, butter\nI don’t know what to say or think, but somehow\nThese words’ll come out as I burn this haze and drink\nI’ll remember when I first met you.  Summer of ninety-\n-one.  Who would ever think that the god would sweat you?\nIf you ask for my time, I would never neglect you\nOr disrespect you, risk my own life to protect you\nMy, you’re more than a precious jewel, diamond in the rough\nDimes you’ll love to puff and you’re crazy cool\nMocha complexion and texture of your hair is smooth\nMesmerized by your eyes while I stare at you\nPlus, the softness of your lips—shit—there are no words to\nDescribe it.  Loving you is my primary assignment\nJust give me your list of promises to keep, and, on the dotted line\nI’ma sign it.  Your voice is harmony like the wine is\nWe could make beautiful music together—then it’s Ashford\nAnd Simpson.  Solid as a rock, I’ll never lose interest\nHugs and kisses\n\nYeah, butter, I’ll spread love to ya\nGive my mind, body, and soul through a hug to ya\nFind a quiet spot to chill and burn the bud with ya\nHit the strip with two burners and drugs with ya\n(You’re gully, ma) Yeah, momma, I’ll spread love to ya\nGive my mind, body, and soul through a hug to ya\nFind a quiet spot to chill and burn the bud with ya\nHit the strip with two burners and drugs with ya\n\nBaby, I know\nYou’re dealing with your personal issues.  I have some of\nMy own.  We’ve both been searching for our comfort zone\nBut while we’re doing that, I can’t ignore the fact that I’m feeling\nYou heavy, and you’re a shortcut to Heaven, most definitely\nI know that money’s not an object, but if I had it\nTo splurge—that’s my word—you’d be out of Douglass Projects\nI know that you deserve the best, fine wine and\nCuisine, top-of-the-line designer things\nA fee with the navigational screen, pounds of purple\nAnd green, full wear to switch up daily for weeks\nYou told me you love diamonds—fine.  Open your mind\n‘Cause, if I could, I’d throw you a whole coalmine\nThrough my gray skies, you’re my rays of sunshine\nAnd I don’t have to worry ‘bout you crying—not one time\n‘Cause, not only are you classy and sassy, but the streets\nIs in your bloodstream and get your grizzly on for the green\nYou heard me?\n\nYeah, butter, I’ll spread love to ya\nGive my mind, body, and soul through a hug to ya\nFind a quiet spot to chill and burn the bud with ya\nHit the strip with two burners and drugs with ya\n(You’re gully, ma)\n\nWhat the\nWorld needs now (I'm telling you)\n(Love is what we need) is love, more\nLove is what we need.  What the\nWorld needs now is (We need more love)\nLove (Whoo!).
